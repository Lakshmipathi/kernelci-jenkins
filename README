Jenkins docker with config-as-code
=================================
This is the jenkins CASC yaml and job-dsl groovy needed to create a pre configured Jenkins for KernelCI.

There are some example docker-compose environment files for production, staging, and development.

Usage
=====
- Choose a .env file and move it to .env, or create your own
- add any extra plugins (github-auth, openstack etc) to the plugins_extra.txt file and they will be included in the build.
- Add your LAVA lab credentials in configs/secrets.yaml
- Any CASC yaml files that exist in /config will also be loaded, so you can create
your own.
- Builders should be configured in /config/nodes.yaml (you will have to create this)
- Add any extra parameters you've used in your config to .env-extra
- Add your LAVA lab token to .env-labs
- Edit the ADMIN_PASSWORD in .env

Execute `docker-compose up --build` and jenkins should launch.

Initially a single job is created, this is the DSL seed job, and within the next
few minutes it will trigger, loading all the other jobs from the git repo
specified in the .env file.
